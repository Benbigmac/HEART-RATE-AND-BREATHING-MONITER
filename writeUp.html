<center>  <h1>Heart Rate and Respiration Lab</h1></center><br>
<center><p>Heartrate and respiratory-rate monitoring wearables could be
used in the areas of mediation and fitness for both children and adults. The goal of this lab is to
develop a wearable elastic chest strap. The chest strap will have embedded electronics to collect
Electrocardiograph (ECG) signal using the AD8232 heart monitoring board, and the respiratory
signal using the conductive cloth sensor connected to the Arduino.</p></center>
